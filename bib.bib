We analyze the scheme in two settings: as a self-contained component in a network providing reliability on a single link, and as a component employed at intermediate nodes in a block-coded end-to-end connection. We believe that the scheme is a good alternative to automatic repeat request when feedback is too slow, too unreliable, or too difficult to implement.}

		 shorter errors that occur more often. The TCP
		 throughput is higher with link layer ARQ than without,
		 provided that the link layer recovers data, and the

		 Link layer ARQ, with an appropriate number of

		 research work have proposed efficient acknowledgment
